# Holiday Rental in Spain: Licenses, Rules and Requirements 2025

![Modern holiday home with bright colors and terrace](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502672260266-1c1ef2d93688?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80)

Do you dream of financing your Spanish holiday home through rental on Airbnb or Booking.com? You're not alone. Thousands of foreign property owners supplement their finances by renting out their Spanish holiday home when they're not using it themselves.

But in recent years, the rules have been tightened dramatically. Where it was once relatively easy to post a listing on Airbnb, legal rental now requires a series of permits, licenses, and approvals. Illegal rental can cost you fines up to €600,000 in extreme cases—and commonly €10,000-40,000 for typical violations.

This comprehensive guide gives you the complete overview of:
- When your property may be rented AT ALL
- What licenses and permits you need
- Regional differences (Andalusia, Valencia, Catalonia, etc.)
- Tax obligations
- Consequences of illegal rental
- Alternatives to short-term rental

## The New Reality: Strict Rules from 2023-2025

### Why Have the Rules Become Stricter?

Spain has experienced an explosion in tourism and short-term rental through platforms like Airbnb. In popular destinations like Barcelona, Malaga, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands, this has led to:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Housing shortage for locals** | Long-term rentals converted to tourist rental |
| **Price increases** | Rents have risen dramatically |
| **Neighborhood deterioration** | "Hotelization" of residential areas |
| **Noise nuisance and disturbances** | Neighbor complaints about partying tourists |

**Political Reaction:**
- New strict laws at both national and regional levels
- Requirements for licenses and registration
- Homeowner associations given the right to ban rentals
- Stricter enforcement and higher fines

**Result:** It has become significantly harder (but not impossible) to rent legally. At the same time, the risk of illegal rental has increased markedly.

### What Counts as "Tourist Rental"?

Tourist rental (*vivienda turística* or *vivienda de uso turístico*) is generally defined as:

- Rental of the **entire property** (not just a room)
- To tourists/guests
- For **shorter periods** (typically under 30 days, some places under 2 months)
- **For profit**
- **Repeatedly** (not just once)

> **Important Nuances:**
> - Rental to the same tenant for over 30 days typically does NOT count as tourist rental
> - Rental without payment (to family/friends) is normally OK
> - A single rental may be legal, but repeated rental requires a license

---

## Step 1: Check If Your Property Can Be Rented

Before you even begin the process of applying for licenses, you must ensure that your property actually MAY be rented.

### Homeowner Association Approval - NEW CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**Law Change 2023:** A new law (*Ley de Vivienda*) gave homeowner associations the right to ban or restrict tourist rental.

**What Does This Mean?**

Your *Comunidad de Propietarios* (homeowner association) can now:
- **Ban** tourist rental completely
- **Limit** the number of units that may be rented
- **Set special requirements** (soundproofing, deposit, etc.)

**Requirements for the Decision:**
- Requires **3/5 majority** at the general meeting
- Must be incorporated into the association's bylaws (*estatutos*)
- Only applies prospectively (existing legal rentals can normally continue)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Check BEFORE you buy!**
> If you're considering buying a holiday home for rental purposes:
> 1. Request a **copy of the homeowner association's bylaws** (*estatutos*)
> 2. Read **minutes from recent general meetings** (*actas de junta*)
> 3. Ask **explicitly**: May the property be rented for tourism?
> 4. Get it **confirmed in writing**

Many buyers discover too late that the homeowner association has banned rental. You cannot demand this be reversed, and your investment may be lost.

### Zone Restrictions and Local Plans

In addition to homeowner association rules, there may be **municipal or regional zoning regulations** that restrict or prohibit tourist rental.

**Examples of Restrictions:**

| Location | Restrictions |
|----------|--------------|
| **Barcelona** | Near-total stop for new tourist licenses since 2016; only specific zones allow applications |
| **Palma (Mallorca)** | Ban on tourist rental in city center apartments; only single-family houses and specially approved buildings |
| **Seville** | Certain historic districts have restrictions; maximum number of licenses per block |
| **Málaga** | No new licenses in center; restrictions in popular zones like Málaga Este |

**How to Check:**
1. Contact your municipality's **tourism office** (*departamento de turismo*)
2. Check the municipality's website for rules on *viviendas turísticas*
3. Some municipalities have online maps with permitted/not-permitted zones
4. Ask a local *gestor* or lawyer

---

## Step 2: Apply for Tourist License

If your property MAY be rented (approved by homeowner association and not in a prohibited zone), the next step is to apply for the required tourist license.

### What is the Tourist License?

The tourist license is an **official permit** from your regional government to operate tourist rental.

**The Name Varies by Region:**

| Region | License Type |
|--------|--------------|
| **Andalusia** | VFT (*Vivienda con Fines Turísticos*) |
| **Valencia** | VT (*Vivienda Turística*) |
| **Catalonia** | HUTB/HUT (*Habitatge d'Ús Turístic*) |

| **Canary Islands** | VV (*Vivienda Vacacional*) |
| **Madrid** | VUT (*Vivienda de Uso Turístico*) |
| **Murcia** | VUT |

**The License Number** (e.g., VFT/MA/12345) must:
- Appear in all advertisements (Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.)
- Be displayed at the property entrance
- Be stated on rental contracts

### Requirements for the Property

## Step 3: Tax Obligations

When you rent out your Spanish holiday home, you get a number of new tax obligations—both in Spain and your home country.

### Spanish Tax on Rental Income

As a non-resident who rents out property, you must pay Spanish tax via **Modelo 210** - quarterly!

| Taxpayer | Tax Rate |
|----------|----------|
| **EU Citizens** | 19% |
| **Non-EU Citizens** | 24% |

**Tax Base:**
For EU citizens, you can deduct **actual expenses** (up to 50% of income):

```
Net Rental Income = Gross Income - Deductible Expenses
Tax = Net Rental Income × 19%
```

**Deductible Expenses (up to 50% of income):**
- IBI (property tax)
- Homeowner association fees (*gastos de comunidad*)
- Water, electricity, gas
- Insurance
- Repairs and maintenance
- Cleaning between guests
- Platform fees (Airbnb commission, etc.)
- *Gestor* fees
- Furniture depreciation (with documentation)

**Example:**
```
Gross Income (annual): €15,000
Platform fees (Airbnb 14%): -€2,100
Cleaning: -€1,500
Homeowner association: -€800
IBI: -€400
Insurance: -€300
Electricity, water: -€600
Maintenance: -€500
Total expenses: -€6,200

Net income: €8,800
Tax (19%): €1,672 annually
```

### Modelo 210 - Quarterly Filing

**Deadlines:**
| Quarter | Filing Deadline |
|---------|-----------------|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | April 20 |
| Q2 (Apr-Jun) | July 20 |
| Q3 (Jul-Sep) | October 20 |
| Q4 (Oct-Dec) | January 20 (next year) |

> **💡 Strong Recommendation:** Use a *gestor* or *asesor fiscal* for this. It costs €50-100 per quarter but ensures correct filing and maximizes your deductions.

### VAT (IVA) on Rental?

**General Rule:** Holiday home rental is **VAT exempt**.

**Exception:** If you provide **hotel-like services** (daily cleaning, breakfast, concierge), it may become VAT-liable. This is rare for private landlords.

### Home Country Tax on Spanish Rental Income

If you're fully tax liable in your home country, you must **also** report your Spanish rental income there.

**Double Taxation?**
No! Most countries provide **relief** for Spanish tax paid (credit method). You pay the highest rate, but not double.

---

## Platforms: Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.

### License Number Requirement in Listings

**Legal Requirement in All Regions:**
You MUST show your license number (e.g., VFT/MA/12345) in your listing.

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|--------------|
| **Airbnb** | "License number" or "Registration number" field must be filled correctly; Airbnb checks and can remove listings without valid number |
| **Booking.com** | Similar requirements; platforms are required to enforce this |

**Consequence of Missing Number:**
- Listings can be removed
- Fines from authorities
- Platforms report to authorities (in some regions)

### Reporting Obligation to Authorities

In several regions, you must report **guest information** to the police.

**What Must Be Reported:**
- Guest's full name
- Nationality
- Passport number
- Check-in and check-out date

**Deadline:** Typically within 24 hours of arrival

## What Does It Cost to Become Legal?

Let's be honest: Operating legal tourist rental costs money. Here's a realistic overview:

### One-Time Expenses (First Time)

| Expense | Estimate |
|---------|----------|
| **Lawyer/gestor** (help with application) | €300-800 |
| **License fee** (regional authority) | €50-150 |
| **Air conditioning** (if not already installed) | €500-1,500 |
| **Fire extinguisher, first aid kit** | €50-100 |
| **Smoke alarm** | €20-50 |
| **Professional photos** | €100-300 |
| **Liability insurance** (first year) | €150-300 |
| **Energy certificate** (if needed) | €150-300 |
| **Total one-time cost** | **€1,320-3,500** |

### Annual Operating Expenses

| Expense | Estimate |
|---------|----------|
| **Gestor** (quarterly Modelo 210) | €200-400/year |
| **Liability insurance** | €150-300/year |
| **Platform fees** (Airbnb/Booking 14-18%) | 14-18% of income |
| **Cleaning** (between each guest) | €50-80 per guest |
| **Linen washing/changing** | €15-25 per guest |
| **Maintenance** (ongoing repairs) | €500-1,000/year |
| **Utilities** (electricity, water - guests use more) | €600-1,200/year |

---

## Consequences of Illegal Rental

Many think: "What's the real risk? Can they even discover it?"

The truth is: **Yes, they can—and they do.**

### How Is Illegal Rental Discovered?

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Platform Control** | Airbnb and Booking.com are required to check license numbers; in some regions they report directly to authorities |
| **Neighbor Reports** | Neighbors are often the first to report, especially with noise issues or many changing guests |
| **Active Inspections** | Tourism inspectors patrol popular areas; check online listings against license registries |
| **Data Checks** | Cross-references between Catastro, homeowner association registries, and tourism registries |

### Fines and Sanctions

| Violation | Classification | Typical Fine |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Rental without license | Serious | €10,000-40,000 |
| Rental despite ban (homeowner association/zone) | Very serious | €20,000-100,000 |
| False information in application | Very serious | €20,000-100,000 |
| Lack of hygiene or safety | Serious | €4,000-40,000 |
| Not displaying license number | Minor | €2,000-4,000 |
| Not reporting guests | Minor | €300-3,000 |
| Exceeding max. capacity | Serious | €6,000-40,000 |

**Repeated Violations:**
- Fines doubled or tripled
- Permanent ban from applying for license
- Legal liability for accidents

**Extreme Cases:**
- Fines up to **€600,000** are possible (but rare)
- This is for repeated, serious violations with large commercial activity

---

## Alternative: Long-Term Rental

If the strict rules for tourist rental deter you, long-term rental may be an alternative.

### What Is Long-Term Rental?

- Lease contract for **minimum 12 months** (in practice often 11 months + renewal)
- For permanent residence (not vacation)
- With standard lease contract (*contrato de arrendamiento*)

### Advantages of Long-Term Rental

| Category | Advantages |
|----------|------------|
| **Fewer Rules** | No tourist license required; no homeowner association approval needed; no A/C/heating requirements; simpler administration |
| **Stable Income** | Guaranteed monthly payment; less work with bookings; less wear (same tenant) |
| **Tax** | Annual filing (not quarterly); often larger deductions (60% standard deduction for non-residents) |

### Disadvantages of Long-Term Rental

| Category | Disadvantages |
|----------|---------------|
| **Lower Income** | Long-term rent: €600-1,000/month vs. tourist rental often 2-3× more per month |
| **Tenant Protection** | Difficult to get tenant to leave (strong tenant protection in Spain); if tenant doesn't pay, can take 6-12 months to get eviction order |
| **Limited Personal Use** | You cannot use the property when you want; typically only between tenancy periods |

## Conclusion

Legal rental of a holiday home in Spain in 2025 is **possible, but requires preparation and compliance with many rules**.

**Key Points:**
1. **Check first:** May your property even be rented? (Homeowner association + zone rules)
2. **Get license:** Apply for the correct tourist license for your region
3. **Meet requirements:** Air conditioning, heating, safety, documents
4. **Compliance:** Quarterly tax, guest reporting, correct advertising
5. **Costs:** Be realistic—it costs €1,500-3,500 to start, plus ongoing expenses

**Is It Worth It?**
- ✅ **Yes**, if your property can get a license and you can achieve high occupancy
- ✅ **Yes**, if you professionalize it and use gestor/property manager
- ❌ **No**, if the homeowner association has banned it or you're in a restricted zone
- ❌ **No**, if you're not willing to follow all rules (the risk is too great)

**The Alternative:**
Long-term rental provides lower income but much less administrative hassle and no risk of large fines.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### May I rent out my holiday home without a tourist license just a few weeks per year?
No, repeated rental—even just a few weeks—requires a tourist license in almost all regions. A single rental may possibly not be sanctioned, but repeated rentals (e.g., multiple times on Airbnb) are almost always discovered and can result in fines of €10,000-40,000.

### Can my homeowner association really ban me from renting?
Yes. After the law change in 2023, homeowner associations can with 3/5 majority ban or restrict tourist rental. This decision is legally binding, and if you rent despite the ban, you can get both fines from authorities (€20,000-100,000) and be sued by the homeowner association.

### What happens if I'm caught in illegal rental?
You will typically receive a fine of €10,000-40,000 for the first violation. Your listing will be removed from platforms. If you continue, the fine can rise to €100,000+. Additionally, you may face tax claims for estimated unpaid tax, and you'll be permanently excluded from getting a tourist license.

### Can I just use my home country address and hope they don't discover it?
No, this is a bad idea. Authorities cross-check platforms like Airbnb with license registries. Neighbors often report illegal rental. The risk is high, and the consequences are serious. Additionally, platforms themselves violate rules if they let you advertise without a license number.

### How much can I realistically earn from legal rental?
It depends greatly on location and season. Costa del Sol: €12,000-20,000/year gross is realistic for a good apartment. Costa Blanca: €10,000-18,000. Mallorca: €15,000-25,000. But after deducting platform fees (15%), cleaning, tax, and operations, net is often €5,000-10,000 annually.

### Do I have to pay tax in both Spain and my home country?
If you're fully tax liable in your home country: Yes, you must report in both countries, BUT most countries provide relief (credit) for Spanish tax, so you don't pay double. You effectively pay the higher of the two rates. Use an accountant with international experience.

### What if I only rent to family and friends for free?
Rental without payment to family/friends is normally not classified as tourist rental and therefore doesn't require a license. But beware: If you do it through Airbnb even at a low price, it may still be assessed as commercial activity. Do it privately without a platform.

### Can I convert from tourist rental to long-term rental?
Yes, this is possible at any time. You just need to cancel your tourist listings and enter a regular lease contract for at least 12 months. You can keep the tourist license inactive or cancel it. Long-term rental requires no special license.

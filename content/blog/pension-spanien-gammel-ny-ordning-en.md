# Pension in Spain: Old vs. New Regime Explained

![Elderly couple on terrace with sea view in Spain](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1473496169904-658ba7c44d8a?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80)

Enjoying your pension under the Spanish sun is the dream for thousands of Danish pensioners. But when the dream is to become reality, many encounter complex questions about tax and pension: Where should I pay tax? Do I need to report in both countries? What do "old regime" and "new regime" mean?

In this guide, you'll get the complete overview of how Danish pensions are taxed in Spain, which regime you're covered by, and what it means for your finances. We'll go through all types of pensions, compare the two regimes with concrete examples, and give you a checklist for before you move.

Let's start with the crucial dividing line: Were you residing in Spain and receiving pension by January 2008? The answer to this question determines everything.

---

## Background: The Termination of the Double Taxation Treaty

To understand "old regime" and "new regime," we need to briefly go back in history.

### What Happened in 2008-2009?

Until 2008, Denmark and Spain had a double taxation agreement that regulated which country could tax different types of income. For pensions, the agreement meant that **Danish pensions should be taxed in Spain** if the pensioner lived there.

On July 11, 2008, the Danish government unilaterally terminated the double taxation agreement with Spain. The termination took effect on **January 1, 2009**.

**Why was the agreement terminated?**

The official reason was that Spain used the agreement to give Danish pensioners a tax advantage that was not intended. Specifically:
- Many Danish pensioners paid very low or no tax in Spain due to thresholds
- Denmark lost tax revenue without pensioners necessarily paying in Spain
- The system was perceived as "double non-taxation" instead of "avoidance of double taxation"

### The Transitional Arrangement - "Old Regime"

To protect pensioners who had already organized their lives according to the old rules, a **transitional arrangement** (old regime) was introduced:

Pensioners who met specific criteria could continue under the old rules, where the pension is taxed in Spain. Everyone else came under "new regime," where Denmark taxes the pension.

This division today creates two parallel systems with fundamentally different tax consequences.

---

## Old Regime - Who Is Covered?

"Old regime" is the most advantageous arrangement for most pensioners. But the criteria are very specific, and you must be able to document that you meet them all.

### Criteria for Old Regime

To be covered by old regime, ALL of the following conditions must be met:

**1. Residing in Spain by November 28, 2007**

You must have been tax resident in Spain by November 28, 2007 (the date of publication of the termination).

Tax residence means:
- Staying more than 183 days in Spain during the calendar year 2007
- Or having your **center of vital interests** (family and economic center) in Spain

**Documentation:**
- Empadronamiento (municipal registration) from before Nov 28, 2007
- Spanish tax return for 2007
- Residencia (green certificate) issued before Nov 28, 2007
- Airline tickets, receipts showing stay in Spain

**2. Received Pension from Denmark in January 2008**

You must have received pension (state pension, ATP, or private pension) from Denmark in January 2008.

If your pension first began in February 2008 or later, you are NOT covered by old regime - regardless of how long you've lived in Spain.

**Documentation:**
- Account statements from January 2008 showing pension payment
- Statement from Udbetaling Danmark
- Annual tax statement for 2008

**3. Not Left Spain Since**

You must have maintained your tax residence in Spain continuously since 2007/2008.

If you moved back to Denmark for a period and later returned to Spain, you have **lost** your right to old regime.

**Exception:** Brief stays in Denmark under 183 days annually do not affect residence status.

> **⚠️ Important:** Some pensioners mistakenly believed they could move home to Denmark for some years and later return under old regime. They cannot. Old regime requires uninterrupted residence in Spain from 2007/2008 onwards.

---

### How You're Taxed Under Old Regime

Under old regime, the original rules from the double taxation agreement apply:

**Taxation Country: Spain**

Your Danish pension is taxed in Spain as part of your ordinary income. This means:

**Spanish Tax Rates (Progressive Scale)**

Spain uses a progressive income tax scale that varies slightly between regions. Example from Andalusia (2024):

| Income (EUR) | Marginal Tax |
|--------------|--------------|
| 0 - 12,450 | 19% |
| 12,450 - 20,200 | 24% |
| 20,200 - 35,200 | 30% |
| 35,200 - 60,000 | 37% |
| 60,000 - 300,000 | 45% |
| Over 300,000 | 47-48% |

> **📝 Note:** This is only the state tax. Regional tax is added, so the combined scale can reach 48-50% in the top bracket.

**Thresholds and Deductions**

The crucial thing under old regime is that Spain has **significant thresholds** for pensioners:

| Age | Threshold (2024) |
|-----|-----------------|
| Under 65 | €5,550/year |
| Over 65 | €7,750/year |
| Over 75 | €8,100/year |

This means:
- If your total taxable income is under the threshold, you pay **no tax**
- Income above the threshold is taxed progressively

**No Danish Withholding Tax**

Under old regime, **no Danish tax** is withheld from your pension. Denmark doesn't have taxation rights, so the pension is paid gross to your bank account.

This is a big practical advantage: You receive the full amount and only pay tax in Spain.

---

### Advantages of Old Regime

For most pensioners, old regime is clearly advantageous:

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ✅ Often lower total taxation | Significant savings especially on low to medium pensions |
| ✅ No Danish withholding tax | Pension paid gross, better liquidity |
| ✅ Spanish thresholds | Many pensioners with modest pensions pay little or no tax |
| ✅ Simpler administration | Only deal with one tax system (Spanish) |
| ✅ Wealth tax relief | Pension assets in Denmark don't count toward Spanish wealth |

> **💡 Example:**
>
> Danish pensioner with state pension + ATP = 180,000 kr/year (approx. €24,000)
>
> **Under Old Regime:**
> - Threshold (65+): €7,750
> - Personal deduction: €6,700
> - Taxable income: approx. €9,550
> - Tax (approx. 19%): approx. €1,815/year
> - **Effective tax rate: 7.6%**
>
> **If Same Person Paid Danish Tax:**
> - Base tax + health contribution: approx. 38%
> - Tax: approx. 68,400 kr/year (€9,170)
> - **Effective tax rate: 38%**
>
> **Savings with old regime: Over €7,000 annually**

---

## New Regime - Who Is Covered?

If you don't meet the criteria for old regime, you're automatically covered by "new regime."

### Criteria for New Regime

New regime covers all pensioners who:

| Situation | Under New Regime? |
|-----------|------------------|
| Moved to Spain after November 2007 | ✅ Yes |
| Lived in Spain before Nov 2007 but first received pension later (e.g., 2012) | ✅ Yes |
| Were under old regime but moved back to Denmark and later returned to Spain | ✅ Yes |

**Conclusion:** New regime is the **norm** today. Old regime is an exception for a limited group of older pensioners.

---

### How You're Taxed Under New Regime

Under new regime, the ordinary Danish tax rules apply, as there is no longer a valid double taxation agreement.

**Taxation Country: Denmark**

Denmark taxes your Danish pension as if you lived in Denmark. This means:

**Danish Withholding Tax**

Danish withholding tax is deducted directly from your pension, typically:

| Tax Type | Rate |
|----------|------|
| Base tax | 12.09% |
| Health contribution | 0% (emigrants exempt) |
| Municipal tax | Varies, typically 25% |
| Church tax | Voluntary, typically 0.5-1.5% |
| **Total withholding** | **approx. 37-40%** |

The pension is thus paid **after tax** to your account.

> **💡 Example:**
> - State pension + ATP: 180,000 kr/year
> - Danish withholding tax (38%): -68,400 kr
> - Paid to you: 111,600 kr/year (approx. €14,950)

**Spain Also Has Taxation Rights**

Even though Denmark taxes the pension, Spain as your country of residence also has the right to tax your total worldwide income, including Danish pensions.

This creates **double taxation**.

---

### The Dual Reporting Obligation

Under new regime, you must report your pension in **BOTH** countries. This is one of the regime's biggest burdens.

**In Denmark:**

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Tax return (annual statement) | Deadline: May 1 (same as other Danes), reported digitally via TastSelv, use form for "limited tax liable" |
| What's reported | Danish pension, any other Danish income, deduction for foreign tax (paid in Spain) |
| TastSelv access | Requires NemID/MitID - many emigrants lose access, apply for "NemID for emigrants" or use power of attorney |

**In Spain:**

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Tax return (Declaración de la Renta) | Deadline: June 30 (year after income year), reported digitally or via gestor, requires certificado digital or Cl@ve PIN |
| What's reported | ALL worldwide income incl. Danish pensions, assets (if above threshold), any foreign assets in Modelo 720 (separate) |
| Relief for Danish tax | Document paid Danish tax, Spanish return gives credit for Danish tax, only pay difference if Spanish tax is higher |

**Documentation of Paid Danish Tax:**

To get relief in Spain, you must document the paid Danish tax:
- Danish annual statement (translation may be necessary)
- Account statements showing withholding tax
- Statement from Udbetaling Danmark or ATP

Many gestores and Spanish tax authorities don't know the Danish system, so you must be prepared to explain and document.

---

### Example of Double Taxation and Relief

**Situation:**
- Danish pensioner under new regime, living in Andalusia
- State pension + ATP: 180,000 kr/year (approx. €24,000)
- Over 65 years

**Danish Taxation:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross income | 180,000 kr |
| Personal deduction | 49,700 kr |
| Taxable income | 130,300 kr |
| Base tax (12.09%) | 15,755 kr |
| Municipal tax (25%) | 32,575 kr |
| **Total Danish tax** | **48,330 kr (approx. €6,480)** |
| Paid out | 131,670 kr (approx. €17,650) |

**Spanish Taxation (Calculation):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross income | €24,000 |
| Personal deduction (65+) | €6,700 |
| Threshold | €7,750 (but income above, so limited effect) |
| Taxable income | approx. €17,300 |
| Spanish tax before relief | approx. €3,100 |

**Relief:**
- Paid in Denmark: €6,480
- Calculated in Spain: €3,100
- Since Danish tax is higher, no additional tax is paid in Spain
- **Total tax: €6,480 (only Danish tax)**

**Conclusion:** In this example, the pensioner ends up only paying Danish tax because it's higher than Spanish. But the administrative burden of dual reporting remains.

## Comparison: Old vs. New Regime

Let's compare the two regimes directly with a detailed table and concrete examples.

### Major Comparison Table

| Aspect | Old Regime | New Regime |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Who's covered** | Residing before Nov 28, 2007 + received pension Jan 2008 | Everyone else |
| **Taxation country** | Spain | Denmark (primarily) |
| **Danish withholding** | No | Yes (37-40%) |
| **Spanish tax return** | Yes | Yes |
| **Danish tax return** | No (only if other income) | Yes |
| **Thresholds** | Spanish (advantageous) | Danish (higher) |
| **Progressive scale** | Spanish (19-48%) | Danish (37-56%) |
| **Effective tax (low pension)** | 0-10% | 37-40% |
| **Effective tax (medium pension)** | 15-25% | 38-42% |
| **Effective tax (high pension)** | 30-45% | 45-56% |
| **Administrative burden** | Low (only Spain) | High (both countries) |
| **Need for gestor/accountant** | Yes (Spain) | Yes (both countries) |

---

### Example: Pension of 300,000 kr/year

Let's compare concretely for a pensioner with a medium-sized pension.

**Basic Data:**
- Age: 68 years
- State pension: 100,000 kr/year
- ATP: 30,000 kr/year
- Private annuity pension: 170,000 kr/year
- **Total pension: 300,000 kr/year (approx. €40,200)**

**Under Old Regime (Spain Taxes):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross income | €40,200 |
| Personal deduction (65+) | €6,700 |
| Taxable income | €33,500 |
| Spanish tax (progressive) | €8,215 |
| **Effective tax rate** | **20.4%** |
| **Net after tax** | **€31,985/year (238,000 kr)** |

**Under New Regime (Denmark Taxes, Relief in Spain):**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Danish tax (after deductions) | 92,836 kr (€12,450) |
| Spanish calculated tax | €8,215 |
| Relief (Danish > Spanish) | No additional Spanish tax |
| **Total tax** | **€12,450 (92,836 kr)** |
| **Effective tax rate** | **31%** |
| **Net after tax** | **€27,750/year (207,164 kr)** |

**Comparison:**

| Regime | Total Tax | Effective Rate | Net After Tax | Annual Difference |
|--------|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Old | €8,215 | 20.4% | €31,985 | - |
| New | €12,450 | 31% | €27,750 | - |
| **Difference** | **+€4,235** | **+10.6%** | **-€4,235** | **€4,235 saved with old** |

**Conclusion:** For this pensioner, old regime means **savings of over €4,200 annually** - or 31,600 kr. That's a significant difference.

Over 10 years, the difference is €42,000 - a fortune for most pensioners.

## Which Pension Types Are Taxed Where?

Not all pension types are treated equally. Let's go through the different types.

### State Pension and ATP

| Pension Type | Old Regime | New Regime |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| **State Pension (Folkepension)** | Taxed in Spain | Taxed in Denmark with withholding |
| **ATP** | Same as state pension | Same as state pension |

**Practical Note:** ATP and state pension are paid monthly. Under new regime, withholding tax is deducted automatically.

---

### Annuity Pension and Life Annuity

| Pension Type | Old Regime | New Regime |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Annuity Pension (Ratepension)** | Taxed in Spain | Taxed in Denmark with withholding |
| **Life Annuity (Livrente)** | Taxed in Spain | Taxed in Denmark with withholding |

---

### Capital Pension

**Capital Pension** (lump sum payment) is a special category because it's paid as a single lump sum.

| Regime | Taxation |
|--------|----------|
| **Old Regime** | Taxed in Spain as capital income, progressive scale 19-26% |
| **New Regime** | Taxed in Denmark at 40% (reduced from 50% in 2024) |

**Strategic Consideration:**

If you're considering moving to Spain and have a capital pension:
- Consider paying it out BEFORE or AFTER emigration
- Timing can have significant tax implications
- Seek advice on exit taxation and the 5-year rule

---

### Civil Servant Pension (Special Rule)

**Civil Servant Pension** is treated differently than other pensions:

> **⚠️ EXCEPTION:** Civil servant pension is ALWAYS taxed in Denmark (source country principle) - even under old regime!

| Regime | Civil Servant Pension | Other Pensions |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Old Regime** | Taxed in Denmark | Taxed in Spain |
| **New Regime** | Taxed in Denmark | Taxed in Denmark |

**Definition of Civil Servant Pension:**
- Pension from state, regions, municipalities
- Judges, police, military, teachers (before 2008), etc.
- Not private company pension

**Practical Consequence:**

If you have both civil servant pension and state pension under old regime:
- Civil servant pension: Taxed in Denmark
- State pension: Taxed in Spain
- You must deal with BOTH tax systems
- Relief rules must be applied

---

### Retirement Savings (Aldersopsparing)

**Retirement Savings** (introduced 2013):
- Taxation occurs continuously (PAL tax) during the savings period
- Payout is tax-free
- Under old regime: Tax-free in Spain (since tax is paid in Denmark)
- Under new regime: Tax-free in both countries

This is one of the few pension types where there's no difference between the regimes.

---

## Wealth Tax in Spain - Remember This!

In addition to income tax, as a resident in Spain you must also be aware of **wealth tax** (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio).

### What Is Wealth Tax?

Wealth tax is an annual tax on your net assets (assets minus liabilities). Not all countries have wealth tax - Denmark doesn't - but Spain does.

**Important Points:**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Regional administration** | Wealth tax is administered regionally, big differences between regions |
| **Thresholds** | Most regions have a threshold below which you don't pay wealth tax |
| **Progressive rates** | Typically 0.2% to 2.5-3.5% for assets over 10 million euros |

**Regional Differences:**

| Region | Threshold | Primary Home Deduction | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Andalusia | €700,000 | €300,000 | 100% rebate (effectively abolished) |
| Madrid | €700,000 | €300,000 | 99% rebate (effectively abolished) |
| Valencia | €500,000 | €300,000 | Normal rates apply |
| Catalonia | €500,000 | €300,000 | Higher rates |
| Balearic Islands | €700,000 | €300,000 | Higher rates |

**What Counts Toward Assets?**

- Real estate (in Spain and abroad)
- Bank accounts and cash
- Securities (stocks, bonds)
- Cars, boats, aircraft
- Jewelry and art
- Life insurance with surrender value
- **Pension assets:** Only if "accessible"

**Special Note on Pension Assets:**

| Regime | Pension Assets in Wealth Calculation |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| **Old Regime** | Pensions paid out over time (annuity, life annuity) do NOT count - they're not "accessible assets" |
| **New Regime** | Same rule |

Capital pension or depot not yet paid out: Does NOT count (not yet accessible).
When paid out and deposited in bank account: Counts.

## Practical Checklist: Before You Move

If you're considering moving to Spain as a pensioner, here's a comprehensive checklist of things you should consider and act on.

### 10-Point Checklist

- [ ] S1 gives right to Spanish public healthcare
- [ ] Consider private supplementary insurance
- [ ] Clarify dental and medication coverage

**9. Find Gestor/Lawyer in Spain**

---

### Timing of Move

The timing of your emigration can have significant tax implications:

| Recommendation | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| ✅ Consider moving January 1 | Entire income year will be as Spanish resident, simpler tax calculation |
| ❌ Avoid moving mid-year | Split year gives complex tax calculation, must calculate pro rata income for both countries |

**Before Emigration:**
- Consider payout of capital pension
- Clarify exit taxation
- Make Spanish will
- Open Spanish bank account (can be done before emigration)

**After Emigration:**
- Empadronamiento (municipal registration) within 3 months
- NIE number (if not already)
- Residencia (green certificate)
- Registration with Spanish healthcare with S1

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I Switch from New to Old Regime?

No, unfortunately not. Old regime is based on your situation in 2007/2008. If you didn't meet the criteria then, you can never come under old regime - regardless of how long you live in Spain going forward.

Conversely, you can lose old regime by moving back to Denmark and later returning to Spain.

---

### What If I Move Back to Denmark?

If you move back to Denmark, your tax status changes:

| From | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| **Old Regime** | You lose old regime permanently. If you later move to Spain again, you'll be under new regime |
| **New Regime** | Continues under Danish taxation (as you already were). But you no longer need to do Spanish tax return |
| **Civil Servant Pension** | Always taxed in Denmark, regardless of where you live |

> **⚠️ Practical Note:** Many pensioners choose to live in Spain in winter and Denmark in summer. Be careful not to exceed the 183-day threshold, as this can change your tax residence.

---

### How Do I Document Old Regime?

If you're under old regime, tax authorities (both Danish and Spanish) can require documentation that you meet the criteria:

**Documents You Should Keep:**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Empadronamiento from before Nov 28, 2007 | Proof of residence in Spain |
| Spanish tax return for 2007 | Shows tax residence |
| Residencia issued before Nov 28, 2007 | Strong proof |
| Account statements from January 2008 | Shows pension payment |
| Statement from Udbetaling Danmark | Confirms when you started receiving pension |
| Continuous empadronamiento and tax returns | Proves uninterrupted residence |

> **💡 Practical Advice:** Keep ALL these documents safely. Scan them and store digitally in the cloud. Authorities can require them many years later, especially when moving between regions or in inheritance cases.

---

### What About Swedish or Norwegian Pension?

If you receive pension from Sweden or Norway in addition to your Danish pension, special rules apply:

| Country | Double Taxation Agreement | Pension Taxation |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Sweden** | Still valid with Spain | Swedish pension normally taxed in Spain (as country of residence), exception for certain public pensions |
| **Norway** | Still valid with Spain | Norwegian pension taxed in Spain, exception for public pensions |

**Practical Consequence:**

If you have both Danish and Swedish pension:
- Danish pension: Follows old/new regime as described
- Swedish pension: Taxed in Spain
- Must be coordinated in both Spanish and possibly Swedish tax return

This can get complex. Seek advice from an advisor with experience in multiple countries' pensions.

---

### Should I Have Private Health Insurance?

As a pensioner in Spain, you have several options for health coverage:

**S1 Form (Recommended)**

If you receive Danish pension, you're entitled to S1 form from Denmark:
- Apply from Udbetaling Danmark
- Gives access to Spanish public healthcare
- Denmark pays for your treatment via EU cooperation
- **Free for you**

**Spanish Public Healthcare**

With S1 you have full access to:
- ✅ Doctor and specialists
- ✅ Hospital treatment
- ✅ Emergency treatment
- ✅ Some medication (with co-pay)

**What's NOT Covered:**
- ❌ Dentist (emergency only)
- ❌ Glasses and contact lenses
- ❌ Many forms of physiotherapy

**Private Supplementary Insurance (Consider)**

Many pensioners choose private insurance as supplement:
- Covers dentist
- Faster access to specialists
- Free choice of hospital
- English/Danish-speaking doctors

**Costs:**
- Private insurance: €800-2,000/year depending on age and coverage
- Rises sharply after 70-75 years
- Pre-existing conditions may be excluded

> **💡 Recommendation:** Start with S1 and see if it's sufficient. Add private insurance if you want more comfort or dental coverage.

---

### What Happens to My Danish Pension If I Die in Spain?

Your Danish pension is treated differently depending on type:

| Pension Type | Upon Death |
|--------------|------------|
| **State Pension** | Ceases at death, not inheritable, partner may have right to own state pension |
| **ATP** | Ceases at death, possible spouse pension may be paid, small lump sum to spouse |
| **Annuity Pension** | Remaining value is inheritable, goes to your heirs |
| **Life Annuity** | Normally ceases at death (unless "spouse annuity" or "period-secured") |

**Inheritance Tax:**

Pension assets that are inherited must be handled in both Denmark and Spain:
- Denmark: No inheritance tax (abolished 1995)
- Spain: Inheritance tax depending on region and heirs' relationship to you

> **⚠️ Important Action:** Make a Spanish will that coordinates with your Danish one. Include choice of law (choose Danish inheritance law) to protect your spouse.

---

## Conclusion

Taxation of Danish pensions in Spain is complex, but with the right knowledge you can navigate the system and optimize your tax situation.

### Key Takeaways

**1. Understand Your Regime**
- Old regime: Only if residing before Nov 28, 2007 + received pension Jan 2008
- New regime: Everyone else (the vast majority today)
- The regime cannot be changed

**2. Tax Differences Are Significant**
- Old regime often saves €4,000-8,000/year in tax
- Effective tax: 0-25% (old) vs. 37-45% (new)
- For low pensions, the difference is greatest

**3. Administrative Burden**
- Old regime: Only Spanish tax return
- New regime: Both Danish and Spanish tax return
- Use professional help (gestor/lawyer)

**4. Planning Is Crucial**
- Timing of emigration
- Capital pension and exit taxation (5-year rule)
- Wealth tax depends on region
- Spanish will is essential

**5. Seek Professional Advice**
- Danish tax advisor before emigration
- Spanish gestor/lawyer after emigration
- Cost of €500-1,500/year is a good investment

---

### Is It Worth Moving to Spain Tax-Wise?

**Under Old Regime:** Clear yes for most. Significant tax savings combined with lower cost of living.

**Under New Regime:** More nuanced.
- Tax is typically not lower than in Denmark
- But: Lower cost of living, better weather, quality of life
- Total disposable income can be higher despite higher tax

> **💡 Example:**
>
> - Pension: 300,000 kr/year
> - Tax in Denmark: 100,000 kr
> - Cost of living in Denmark: 150,000 kr
> - Disposable: 50,000 kr

### Next Steps

If you're considering moving to Spain:
1. Calculate your expected tax under new regime
2. Make a budget for cost of living in Spain
3. Contact a Danish tax advisor about exit taxation
4. Visit Spain and find the region that suits you (wealth tax varies!)
5. Plan timing - preferably emigration as of January 1

If you already live in Spain:
1. Clarify if you're under old or new regime
2. Ensure you're reporting correctly in the relevant countries
3. Make Spanish will if you haven't
4. Review wealth tax - are you in the best region for your situation?

With my extensive knowledge and experience, I ensure that your legal matters are handled professionally and efficiently.

Whether you need help with property transactions, family law matters, business formation or tax questions, I work closely with you to ensure you get the most effective solution.\n\nIn addition, I have built an extensive network of professional partners, including real estate agents, auditors and other specialists. This means I can offer you a holistic service that covers all aspects of your project in Spain.\n\nMy multilingualism and cultural understanding of both Denmark and Spain make me the ideal partner for Danish clients who want professional legal assistance in Spain.",
